# NRRD (Nearly Raw Raster Data)
- 의료 영상(CT, MRI) 분야에서 널리 사용되는 파일 형식
- Raster Data(3D Volume) + Metadata
- Metadata Examples
    - Essential:
        - Type: Specifies the data type, such as int, float, double, etc.
        - Dimension: Specifies the number of dimensions of the data (e.g., 1D, 2D, 3D).
        - Sizes: Specifies the size of each dimension in the data.
    - Core:
        - Encoding: Specifies the encoding method for the data, e.g., raw, gzip, etc.
        - Space origin: Provides spatial information about the data, such as the location of the origin in physical space.
        - Space directions: Describes the physical spacing and orientation of the data.
    - User defined:
        - Custom_label: A label created by the user to identify the specific dataset.
        - Subject_name: The name or ID of the subject associated with the data.
        - Experimental_condition: Additional information about the experimental condition when the data was acquired.

```python
# pip install pynrrd
import numpy as np
import nrrd

# Data creation (this example creates a simple 3D array)
data = np.zeros((100, 100, 100), dtype=np.float32)
data[30:70, 30:70, 30:70] = 1.0  # Set some arbitrary data values

# Metadata creation for the data
header = {'spacings': [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],  # Spacing for each axis
          'units': ['mm', 'mm', 'mm'],  # Units for each axis
          'type': 'float',             # Data type
          'encoding': 'gzip',          # Compression method
          'space directions': np.eye(3)  # Adding the space directions for each axis
          }

# Save as NRRD file
output_path = 'example.nrrd'
nrrd.write(output_path, data, header)

print(f"NRRD file has been saved to {output_path}.")
