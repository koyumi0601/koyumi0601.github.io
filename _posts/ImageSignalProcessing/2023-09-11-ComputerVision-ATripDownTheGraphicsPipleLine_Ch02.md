*A Trip Down The Graphics PipleLine, Jim Blinn's Corner*

# The Teapot

- In the January 1987 issue of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, Frank Crow published an article that gave the history of Martin Newell's teapot. He also included a database as an unstructured list of Bezier surfaces. There is some structure to the teapot though, and it allows a much more compact representation. Here it is.

## The Body

- The body of the teapot is a surface of revolution with an outline consisting of three Bezier curves in the xy plane. The surface is generated by rotating this outline curve about the y axis. The control point coordinates are

| point nbr | x      | y       |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1         | 1.4000 | 2.25000 |
| 2         | 1.3375 | 2.38125 |
| 3         | 1.4375 | 2.38125 |
| 4         | 1.5000 | 2.25000 |
| 5         | 1.7500 | 1.72500 |
| 6         | 2.0000 | 1.20000 |
| 7         | 2.0000 | 0.75000 |
| 8         | 2.0000 | 0.30000 |
| 9         | 1.5000 | 0.07500 |
| 10        | 1.5000 | 0.00000 |

Figure 2.1 Outline of the  body

![Figure2_1_OutlineOfTheBody]({{site.url}}/images/$(filename)/Figure2_1_OutlineOfTheBody-1694426502677-2.png)

- The three curves are generated by points(1, 2, 3, 4), (4, 5, 6, 7), and (7, 8, 9, 10). Note that points 3, 4, 5 are colinear, as are points 6, 7, 8, in order to make the segments blend together. A picture of the curve appears in Figure 2.1.

## The Lid

Figure 2.2 Outline of the lid

![Figure2_2_OutlineOfTheLid]({{site.url}}/images/$(filename)/Figure2_2_OutlineOfTheLid.png)

- The lid is also a surface of revolution with a similar geometrical construction as the body. A picture of the lid coutline appears in Figure 2.2. The control point coordinates are

| point nbr | x   | y    |
|-----------|-----|------|
| 1         | 0.0 | 3.00 |
| 2         | 0.8 | 3.00 |
| 3         | 0.0 | 2.70 |
| 4         | 0.2 | 2.55 |
| 5         | 0.4 | 2.40 |
| 6         | 1.3 | 2.40 |
| 7         | 1.3 | 2.25 |

## The handle

Figure 2.3 Outline of the handle

![Figure_2_3_OutlineOfTheHandle]({{site.url}}/images/$(filename)/Figure_2_3_OutlineOfTheHandle.png)

- The handle is symmetrical about the z = 0 plane, so I'm only showing half of it - mirror it in z to get the other half. Each half consists of two patches; each patch has two (opposite) edges in the z = 0 plane. A picture of these four curves (two per patch) appears in Figure 2.3. The control point coordinates are

| point nbr | x     | y      |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 11        | -1.60 | 1.8750 |
| 12        | -2.30 | 1.8750 |
| 13        | -2.70 | 1.8750 |
| 14        | -2.70 | 1.6500 |
| 15        | -2.70 | 1.4250 |
| 16        | -2.50 | 0.9750 |
| 17        | -2.00 | 0.7500 |
| 21        | -1.50 | 2.1000 |
| 22        | -2.50 | 2.1000 |
| 23        | -3.00 | 2.1000 |
| 24        | -3.00 | 1.6500 |
| 25        | -3.00 | 1.2000 |
| 26        | -2.65 | 0.7875 |
| 27        | -1.90 | 0.4500 |


- To generate a whole patch, you need four columns of four control points each. The two outer columns come from the above curves. One patch uses points (11, 12, 13, 14) and (21, 22, 23, 24). The other patch uses (14, 15, 16, 17) and (24, 25, 26, 27). In order to satisfy the smoothness constraint across the mirror plane, the two middle columns must have the same x, y coordinates as their adjacent outer columns. The z coordinates, though, are 0.3 instead of 0.

- To be perfectly explicit, the patch for the top half of the handle has, as its 16 control points, the following coordinates. (The notation for each point is p, z where p is the point number to use for the x, y coordinates.)


|       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 21,.0 | 21,.3 | 11,.3 | 11,.0 |
| 22,.0 | 22,.3 | 12,.3 | 12,.0 |
| 23,.0 | 23,.3 | 13,.3 | 13,.0 |
| 24,.0 | 24,.3 | 14,.3 | 14,.0 |


## The Spout

- The spout is similar to the handle, except that all the z coordinates of the middle columns don't happen to be the same. A picture of the edge curves appears in Figure 2.4. The control point coordinates are

![Figure_2_4_OutlineOfTheSpout]({{site.url}}/images/$(filename)/Figure_2_4_OutlineOfTheSpout-1694475503225-7.png)

| point nbr | x     | y       |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 11        | 1.700 | 1.27500 |
| 12        | 2.600 | 1.27500 |
| 13        | 2.300 | 1.95000 |
| 14        | 2.700 | 2.25000 |
| 15        | 2.800 | 2.32500 |
| 16        | 2.900 | 2.32500 |
| 17        | 2.800 | 2.25000 |
| 21        | 1.700 | 0.45000 |
| 22        | 3.100 | 0.67500 |
| 23        | 2.400 | 1.87500 |
| 24        | 3.300 | 2.25000 |
| 25        | 3.525 | 2.34375 |
| 26        | 3.450 | 2.36250 |
| 27        | 3.200 | 2.25000 |

- Again, in order to satisfy the smoothness constraint, the middle columns of the patch control points must have the same x, y coordinates as their adjacent outer columns. For these middle columns the z coordinates are

| adjacent point nbr | z    |
|--------------------|------|
| 11, 21             | 0.66 |
| 12, 22             | 0.66 |
| 13, 23             | 0.25 |
| 14, 24             | 0.25 |
| 15, 25             | 0.25 |
| 16, 26             | 0.15 |
| 17, 27             | 0.15 |

# Spillage

- The original design of the teapot was a bit taller than the one everybody uses today. This is because once, during a demo for ARPA, we scaled the whole object by 0.75 in the y direction. We thought at the time that they would be so impressed by this capability that they would give us lots more research money. (They didn't.) Anyway, we thought that the low-profile teapot looked prettier so we kept it that way. So, if you scale all the above y coordinates by 1.33333, you will se that the numbers get much rounder.

# Leakage

- Yes, in the original database the bottom of the teapot is missing. You can add a disk of radius 1.5 in the xz plane if that is really important to you.

- And yes, as a matter of fact, the volume of the teapot is almost 42 (but only before it was squashed).
