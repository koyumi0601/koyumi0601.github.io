*A Trip Down The Graphics PipleLine, Jim Blinn's Corner*

# The Teapot

- In the January 1987 issue of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, Frank Crow published an article that gave the history of Martin Newell's teapot. He also included a database as an unstructured list of Bezier surfaces. There is some structure to the teapot though, and it allows a much more compact representation. Here it is.

## The Body

- The body of the teapot is a surface of revolution with an outline consisting of three Bezier curves in the xy plane. The surface is generated by rotating this outline curve about the y axis. The control point coordinates are

| point nbr | x      | y       |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1         | 1.4000 | 2.25000 |
| 2         | 1.3375 | 2.38125 |
| 3         | 1.4375 | 2.38125 |
| 4         | 1.5000 | 2.25000 |
| 5         | 1.7500 | 1.72500 |
| 6         | 2.0000 | 1.20000 |
| 7         | 2.0000 | 0.75000 |
| 8         | 2.0000 | 0.30000 |
| 9         | 1.5000 | 0.07500 |
| 10        | 1.5000 | 0.00000 |
